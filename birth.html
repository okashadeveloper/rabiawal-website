                    The Prophet ﷺ was born in the famous "Year of the Elephant" (Am al-Fil), when Abraha, the Abyssinian
                    ruler of Yemen, attempted to destroy the Kaaba with a massive army that included war elephants.
                    Allah protected His sacred house by sending flocks of birds (Ababil) that pelted the army with
                    stones of baked clay, as mentioned in Surah Al-Fil. This divine protection occurred in the same year
                    our beloved Prophet ﷺ was born, signifying the importance of his coming into this world.
