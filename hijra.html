  <h2>A Journey That Changed History</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    The Hijrah (migration) from Makkah to Madinah in 622 CE marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar 
    and represents one of the most significant events in Islamic history.
  </p>

  <div class="hijrah-content">
    <div class="text-part">
      <h3>Why the Migration?</h3>
      <p>
        The persecution of Muslims in Makkah had reached unbearable levels. The Quraysh tribe had imposed 
        a social and economic boycott on the Muslim community, making life extremely difficult for the believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 13 years of calling people to Islam in Makkah, Allah commanded the Prophet ﷺ to migrate to Madinah, 
        where a group of people had already embraced Islam and pledged to protect and support him.
      </p>

      <div class="assassination-box">
        <h4>The Assassination Plot</h4>
        <p>
          The Quraysh leaders decided to kill the Prophet ﷺ and chose representatives from different tribes 
          to carry out the murder collectively, so no single tribe could be blamed.

      <h3>The Escape</h3>
      <p>
        On the night of the migration, Ali RA slept in the Prophet ﷺ's bed to deceive the assassins.
        The Prophet ﷺ left his house unseen, protected by Allah's miracle.

        They hid in the Cave of Thawr for three days. A spider's web and bird's nest at the cave entrance 
        misled the search parties, showing Allah's protection.

      <p>
        Throughout the 8-day journey, Allah protected them from capture despite 
        the high bounty placed on the Prophet's ﷺ head by the Quraysh.

    <p>
      The people of Madinah (then called Yathrib) welcomed the Prophet ﷺ with great joy and enthusiasm.
      Young girls sang songs of welcome, and the entire city was filled with celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet ﷺ first stayed with Abu Ayyub al-Ansari RA while the first mosque (Masjid an-Nabawi) was being built.
      This mosque would become the center of the new Islamic community and state.
