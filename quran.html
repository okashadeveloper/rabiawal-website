        After this overwhelming experience, Muhammad ﷺ returned home trembling and sought comfort from his beloved wife Khadijah RA.
        She immediately believed in him and provided unwavering support during these crucial early days.

      <p class="support-desc">
        Khadijah RA took him to her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a learned Christian scholar who confirmed that Muhammad ﷺ had indeed
        encountered the same angel that came to Moses (Musa) AS, and that he was destined to be a prophet.

      <h2>The Living Miracle</h2>
      <p>
        Today, the Qur'an is the most widely read and memorized book in the
        world. Millions of Muslims have memorized it completely (known as
        Huffaz), ensuring its preservation in both written and oral form.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qur'an continues to guide over 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide,
        providing spiritual comfort, moral guidance, and practical solutions for
        life's challenges. Its teachings on justice, compassion, knowledge, and
        social responsibility remain as relevant today as they were 1400 years ago.
