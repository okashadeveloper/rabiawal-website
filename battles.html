  <h2>Battles for Truth and Justice</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    The battles fought during the Prophet's Ô∑∫ lifetime were not wars of conquest but defensive actions
    to protect the Muslim community and preserve the freedom to worship Allah.

      <h3>Battle of Badr</h3>
      <p class="date">
        <span class="icon">üìÖ</span> 17 Ramadan, 2 AH (624 CE)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Battle of Badr was the first major battle between the Muslims
        and the Meccan Quraysh tribe. Despite being vastly outnumbered
        (313 Muslims vs 1000 Meccans), the Muslims achieved a decisive
        victory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This battle demonstrated Allah's support for the believers and
        marked a turning point in early Islamic history. The victory boosted
        the morale of the Muslim community and established their reputation
        as a formidable force.

    <h3>The Prophet's Injury</h3>

      In this battle, the Prophet Ô∑∫ was injured when a stone hit his face, breaking his tooth. 
      This showed his humanity and the fact that he shared in the struggles of his companions. 
      His response was to pray for his enemies' guidance rather than curse them.

      <h2>Battle of the Trench (Khandaq)</h2>
      <p class="date"><i class="icon-shield"></i> 5 AH (627 CE)</p>

      <p>
        Also known as the Battle of Ahzab (The Confederates), this was a 27-day siege of Madinah by a coalition of Arabian tribes totaling around 10,000 warriors.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the advice of Salman al-Farisi RA, the Muslims dug a trench around Madinah, a military tactic unknown to the Arabs at that time.
        This innovative defense successfully protected the city and demoralized the attacking forces.
      </p>

        "And Allah repelled those who disbelieved, in their rage, not having obtained any good. 
        And sufficient was Allah for the believers in battle." ‚Äì <span>Quran 33:25</span>
