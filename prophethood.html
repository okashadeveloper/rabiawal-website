        Before receiving his first revelation, Muhammad ﷺ would often retreat to the Cave of Hira on 
        Jabal an-Nour (Mountain of Light) for contemplation and worship. This practice of spiritual reflection 
        prepared him for his great mission.
      </p>
      
      <p class="prophethood-desc">
        At the age of 40, during one of these spiritual retreats in the month of Ramadan, Angel Jibril (Gabriel) 
        appeared to him with the first verses of the Quran, marking the beginning of his prophetic mission.
