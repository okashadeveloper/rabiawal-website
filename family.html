      <h2>Marriage to Khadijah RA</h2>
      <p>
        At the age of 25, Muhammad Ô∑∫ married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid RA,
        a noble and successful businesswoman of Makkah. She was 40 years
        old, and their marriage was based on mutual respect, love, and
        admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Khadijah RA was not only his wife but also his closest companion,
        advisor, and the first person to believe in his message when he
        became a prophet. Their marriage lasted for 25 years until her
        death, and she bore him four daughters and two sons (who died in
        infancy).

          "Mother of the Believers."

      <h2>The Mothers of Believers</h2>
      <p>
        After Khadijah's death, the Prophet Ô∑∫ married several women, each marriage serving important social,
        political, or humanitarian purposes. These wives are called "Mothers of the Believers" (Ummahaat al-Mu'mineen).
      </p>
      <p>
        Notable among them were Aisha RA (daughter of Abu Bakr), Hafsa RA (daughter of Umar), Sawda RA,
        Umm Salama RA, and others. Each brought unique contributions to the early Muslim community and
        helped preserve the teachings of Islam.
